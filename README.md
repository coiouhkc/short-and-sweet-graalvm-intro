# Definition

GraalVM is a high-performance JDK for Java and other JVM languages while also providing runtimes for JavaScript, Python, and a number of other popular languages which can run Java applications on the HotSpot JVM with Graal just-in-time (JIT) compiler or as an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled native executable.
